- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Joukowsky, also known as VÃ­ctor FrancÃ©s Belda.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in computer science, so if you know something about languages or something that you think that it could be interesting, you can share it to me! I'll do the same.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying aerospace engineering at EIIA-UCLM, in Toledo.
- The name 'Joukowsky' comes from a russian mechanical engineer called NikolÃ¡i Zhukovski. He did some researches in the field of aerodynamics and fluid mechanics, so it can be considered a model for me. Furthermore, I think that the name is funny hehee.
- I will upload mainly files from [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/), or simply some codes from my imagination. Although, of course, you never know.
